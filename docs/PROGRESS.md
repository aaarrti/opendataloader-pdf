2026-10-06 — Completed F1. Built the Java CLI, generated JSON/Markdown oracle
outputs for baseline, multipage, table, raster/image, sanitization, and invalid
character PDFs, and recorded invalid-input/password outcomes. Added checksums,
provenance, and task coverage to `samples/oracle/manifest.toml`.

2026-10-06 — Completed M1. Added the Rust document model, parser chunk types,
semantic element variants, image references, and typed conversion errors with
fixture-derived unit tests. `cargo test -p opendataloader_core` and
`cargo check --workspace` pass.

2026-10-06 — Completed P1. Added the local `lopdf` parser for PDF validation,
password classification, page count and geometry, Info metadata, text/image/
line-art chunks, plus fixture-backed tests for baseline, raster, invalid, and
password-protected PDFs. `cargo test --workspace` and `cargo check --workspace`
pass.
